                <h3>Salor Moon</h3>
                <p>Usagi is first introduced as living the life of a normal teenage schoolgirl in 20th-century Tokyo. Although well-meaning, she is an underachieving, accident-prone crybaby. One day, Usagi encounters a mysterious cat with a crescent moon on its forehead, who later reveals herself to be Luna, a mentor archetype who introduces Usagi to her new heroic role. Luna gives Usagi a magical brooch and explains how to use it to transform into Sailor Moon (the Guardian of Love and Justice); she tells Usagi that she is a Sailor Guardian who must fight for peace and find the rest of the Sailor Guardians, as well as their princess. Usagi is a reluctant heroine at first,[6][7] she grows more confident and mature over time. As Sailor Moon, she sets out to fight the villains from her past life and to protect the Earth using the legendary Silver Crystal.</p>

                <h3>Moon Princess</h3>
                <p>Usagi Tsukino (月野 うさぎ, Tsukino Usagi, called Serena Tsukino in the original English dub) is the main protagonist of the series. Usagi is a careless fourteen-year-old girl with an enormous capacity for love, compassion, and understanding. Usagi transforms into the heroine called Sailor Moon, the Guardian of Love and Justice. At the beginning of the series, she is a self-described immature crybaby who resents fighting evil and wants nothing more than to be a normal girl. As the story progresses, however, she embraces the chance to use her power to protect those she cares about.</p>
