                <h2>I am Sailor Moon, champion of justice! On behalf of the moon, I will right wrongs and triumph over evil, and that means you! - sailor moon‚Äù</h2>
                <P>One day in Juban, Tokyo, a middle-school student named Usagi Tsukino befriends Luna, a talking black cat who gives her a magical brooch enabling her to transform into Sailor Moon: a soldier destined to save Earth from the forces of evil. Luna and Usagi assemble a team of fellow Sailor Guardians to find their princess and the Silver Crystal. They encounter the studious Ami Mizuno, who awakens as Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local Shinto shrine maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, a tall and strong transfer student who awakens as Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring idol who had awakened as Sailor Venus a few months prior, accompanied by her talking feline companion Artemis. Additionally, they befriend Mamoru Chiba, a high school student who assists them on occasion as Tuxedo Mask.</P>

                <h3>Luna</h3>
                <p>Luna lived on the moon with Artemis as advisors to Queen Serenity at the palace in the Moon Kingdom. One day, the forces of the Dark Kingdom, lead by Queen Beryl and Queen Metalia, invaded the kingdom. Luna and Artemis spread the word. Later, after seeing Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion die from a blast from Queen Metalia, Luna cried. Despite her plea not to use the crystal sacrifice herself to defeat the Dark Kingdom, the Queen does so and resurrects her daughter and everyone else. Later, the Queen sends her daughter, the Earth Prince, the four princesses of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus, and the entire court to be reincarnated on Earth in the future. Before dying and sending them to Earth in suspended animation, the Queen instructs Luna and Artemis to find the princesses so that they can become the future Sailor Senshi. At some point upon their arrival on Earth, Luna and Artemis split up so they can find the princesses faster. Luna was saved by Usagi, who was the reincarnation of Princess Serenity, when some boys were picking on her. Usagi noticed the bandage on her forehead. When she took it off, it revealed the credentials moon birthmark. Later, at her home in her room, Usagi discovered Luna standing there. She introduced herself to her and told her about her destiny as a future hero.</p>
